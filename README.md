One of my biggest pet projects. React skills are honed here. Different approaches to solving problems are used. A kind of sandbox in which there is no unity of style, but there are many practices in which you can peek if necessary. There are class and functional components. The project is quite large and interesting. I continue to work on it from time to time. Covers a lot of topics from the react.
I didn't really work on the design here, the main idea was to delve into the understanding of React philosophy.
